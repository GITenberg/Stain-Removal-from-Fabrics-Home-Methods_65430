<br /><span class="smaller">HOME METHODS</span></h2>
<p class="center"><b>by
<br />MARGARET S. FURRY, Assistant Textile Chemist</b></p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Off with stains! Keep clothes and home fabrics spotlessly clean. It is
smart and thrifty to take best care of your clothing and household fabrics so
they will look well and last as long as possible.</p>
<p>Many stained and spotted articles are needlessly thrown away each year.
Many others are needlessly ruined by unsuccessful attempts to remove stains.
It is possible to remove practically any stain at home by following a few simple
rules. To take proper care of your fabrics, you will find it worthwhile to learn
enough of the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; skill so that you can do a good job.</p>
<p>One of the most important rules is to remove the stain promptly. Stains that
become old usually require a remover so strong that it sometimes injures the
cloth.</p>
<p>Another important rule is to select a remover that will not harm the cloth.
If you can find out what caused the stain, this also will guide you in choosing
the remover best suited for the job.</p>
<p>Work carefully, patiently, quickly. Often the way in which cleaning is done
is as important as the kind of cleaning materials used, in getting good final
results.</p>
<p>The following pages not only tell how to remove many kinds of stains but
describe as well the general principles of stain removal.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Steps to Success in Stain Removal</span></h2>
<h3 id="c4">Treat Stains Promptly</h3>
<p>First rule for success in removing a stain is to start while it is fresh, even
before it dries if possible. Hot soapsuds or the heat of an iron sets some stains
too, so that it takes strong treatment to loosen them. The professional cleaner
always &ldquo;spots-out&rdquo; stains before he gives a garment a general cleaning or pressing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h3 id="c5">Suit the Remover to the Cloth</h3>
<p>Before starting to treat a stain, be sure you know what the cloth is made of&mdash;whether
cotton, wool, silk, rayon, or a mixture. A stain remover successful
on one kind of cloth may ruin another. Naturally, you want the method that
will do the least possible damage to the cloth.</p>
<h4>Cotton and linen</h4>
<p>Strong acid removers destroy cotton and linen cloth; even mild acids, such as
lemon juice and vinegar, may injure cotton and linen if allowed to remain too
long on the cloth. If you use a mild acid to remove a stain, apply a weak alkali
such as ammonia water or washing or baking soda immediately
to stop the action of the acid. Wash the material in water
after the treatment. (See <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>.) Strong alkalies harm these
materials also, but weak alkalies are safe to use if you rinse
the article well in water afterwards.</p>
<p>All bleaches will rot cotton and linen if allowed to remain on the stain for
more than a minute or two and will remove the color, too. Sodium perborate
and hydrogen peroxide are the safest bleaches to use.</p>
<h4>Wool and silk</h4>
<p>Strong acids and alkalies destroy wool or silk materials. Mild acids, except
nitric, which weakens the material and turns it yellow, are safe to use. Even
mild alkalies such as weak solutions of ammonia water, borax, or
washing soda, must be used with care on wool. Bleaches that
contain chlorine, such as ordinary bleaching powder, also
destroy wool and silk. Sodium perborate is a good bleach
to use, particularly on wool. Use lukewarm water&mdash;hot water turns both
wool and silk yellow, shrinks wool, and injures the finish of silk.</p>
<h4>Rayon and synthetics</h4>
<p>Here are a few safety rules to follow in removing stains from rayon material.
Never use strong acids or alkalies; they injure the material. Mild acids or
alkalies usually do not harm it if properly rinsed. Water
weakens rayon; do not pull or twist it when it is wet. Sodium
perborate and hydrogen peroxide are the safest bleaches to
use, but mild chlorine ones can be used with success.</p>
<p>Three kinds of rayon are made in this country&mdash;viscose, cuprammonium, and
acetate. In removing stains from viscose and cuprammonium rayon, treat the
material like cotton or linen. But acetate rayon is different. It dissolves in
acetone, alcohol, or chloroform, so test a sample of any rayon material before
using these liquids to remove a stain. Mixtures of alcohol and ether, or alcohol
and benzene also are unsafe to use on acetate rayon or on colored material.
Always mix alcohol with 2 or 3 parts of water before using it. Pressing with a
hot iron may melt acetate rayon.</p>
<p>Synthetic materials, such as nylon and vinyon, are not harmed by either
acids or alkalies. Water does not weaken them, as it does the rayon. They
take up very little moisture, and as a result, stains such as coffee, tea, and fruit
juice, remain on the surface and wash off easily. You may use bleaches safely
on nylon or vinyon. But vinyon, like acetate rayon, dissolves in acetone and
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
chloroform, so test a sample of the material before using either of these to
remove a stain. Press nylon with a warm (not hot) iron.</p>
<p>Other synthetic materials are made from peanut, corn, soybean, milk casein,
and fish protein, but as yet they are not common and are not generally recognized.
Treat them as you would silk and wool in removing stains.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Suit the Remover to the Stain</h3>
<p>Find out what the stain is, if possible, before trying to remove it. The
wrong treatment may set a stain so that it is impossible to take it out. Always
test water or any chemical stain remover on a sample of the cloth or on a hidden
part of the garment (seam or hem) to be sure it will not change the color. You
may have to choose between the stain and a faded spot.</p>
<h4>Water</h4>
<p>If the stain is not greasy, first try to remove it with cold water. Hot water
sets many stains and makes them harder to remove. Always test a sample
of the cloth to see if water spots it. If not, place a pad of
clean cloth underneath the stain, with the stain face down.
To sponge, use a soft cloth, dampen it with cold water, and
cover with a layer of dry cloth so that it is not too moist. Then sponge the
stain with light, brushing motions, working from outside of stain to the center.
Spread the moisture into the cloth around stain to keep a ring from forming.</p>
<p>The trick is to spread, or &ldquo;feather out,&rdquo; the liquid around the stain until
there is no definite edge when the material dries. It may help to go over the
spot with a cloth wet with alcohol mixed with 2 parts water. As alcohol
changes some colors and dissolves acetate rayon, use it sparingly. Finally pat
the spot with a dry cloth. Dry rapidly to prevent water rings.</p>

<p class="pcap">Sponge a nongreasy stain with

<p class="pcap">To remove
a water ring, rub
the cloth between
the hands; then
scratch with the
fingernail.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>If a ring has formed, remove it either by sponging the material with clean
water or by shaking it in the steam from a briskly boiling teakettle. Scratching
with the fingernail or a stiff brush or rubbing the cloth between the hands will
sometimes remove a ring.</p>
<h4>Other solvents</h4>
<p>If a stain seems to be greasy, try a grease solvent, such as carbon tetrachloride,
Stoddard solvent, gasoline, benzene, turpentine, ether, acetone, or
alcohol. Most of these do not change the color of fabrics,
but ether, acetone, and alcohol are apt to. So use them
carefully on colored materials; always mix alcohol with 2
parts water. Either sponge the stain with the solvent or dip
into a bowl of the liquid.</p>
<p>To sponge a grease spot, lay the stained material, wrong side up, on a pad of
soft cloth. Apply the remover to the back of the cloth, so that the stain is
washed from the material without having to pass through it. Sponge with a
clean, soft, lintless cloth. Dip the cloth in the liquid and wring out most of the
moisture. Sponge with light, brushing motions, working from the outside of
the spot to the center. Work rapidly and use the solvent sparingly. It is
better to apply the solvent several times quickly than to apply it once and leave
it on for a long time.</p>

<p class="pcap">Sprinkle talcum,
cornstarch, or
chalk on a fresh
grease or oil
stain. Rub it in
well, and let
stand until it absorbs
the grease;
then brush off.</p>
</div>
<p>Avoid rings by spreading the cleaning fluid into the area around the stain and
at the same time blowing lightly on the spot to dry it quickly. Do not rub&mdash;rubbing
may cause light and worn-looking spots that are as bad as the stain.
Change the pad as it becomes soiled. Finally pat the material with a dry cloth.</p>
<p>Always use these solvents out of doors or in a well-ventilated room, as it is
harmful to breathe the vapors. Gasoline, naphtha, and ether catch fire easily
and often explode, so never use them near a fire. Sometimes just rubbing a
garment that is soaked with gasoline will cause it to burst into flames. Benzene,
turpentine, alcohol, and acetone also are inflammable. For this reason, cleaning
with large amounts of these fluids at home is not recommended. Grease-spot
removers made entirely or in large part of carbon tetrachloride will not
catch on fire.</p>
<h4>Absorbent powders</h4>
<p>Absorbent powders&mdash;chalk, talcum, corn meal, cornstarch&mdash;work well on
light, freshly made stains such as grease spots or splatters of salad oil. Also
such powders brush off readily and are safe to use on all
materials. This method is not always successful, however,
if the stain is very large or has become set or dry.
To remove a stain with an absorbent powder, lay the
stained article on a table and sprinkle a layer of the powder over the stain.
Spread the powder around, and when it becomes gummy, shake or brush it off.
Repeat this several times or until the stain disappears. If after several treatments
the stain still shows, place the stain between clean blotting papers and
apply a warm (not hot) iron for several minutes. Stains made by solid fats,
such as butter, must be melted before the blotters can absorb them.</p>

acid to stop the action
of the chlorine.</p>
</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" id="ncfig1" alt="uncaptioned" width="500" height="325" />
</div>
<h4>Bleaches</h4>
<p>Use bleaching chemicals carefully because most bleaches remove the color as
well as the stain, besides weakening the cloth. Colored material in particular
must be treated rapidly and rinsed well in water afterwards.
<b>Javelle water</b> and other chlorine bleaches (sodium hypochlorite
solutions) remove certain stains from uncolored cotton,
linen, or rayon cloth. Do not use them on colored materials or on silk or wool.</p>
<p>To prepare Javelle water: Mix &frac12; pound washing soda in 1 quart of cold
water. Add &frac14; pound of bleaching powder (commonly called chloride of lime).
Strain this liquid through a piece of muslin and store in a bottle with a tight
cork or stopper ready for use.</p>
<p>To remove a stain with Javelle water, stretch the stained part of the cloth
over a bowl filled with cold water and drop the Javelle water on the stain with
a medicine dropper. (If the stain is large, dip the entire garment in the Javelle
water). Never let the Javelle water remain on the stain for more than 1 minute;
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
it rots even linen and cotton materials if allowed to remain on them longer.
Rinse quickly by dipping in the water.</p>
<p>Next apply a few drops of a solution made up of &frac12; teaspoon of sodium thiosulfate
and 1 to 2 teaspoons of vinegar in 1 pint of water. This stops the action
of the chlorine remaining in the cloth after the treatment with Javelle water.
Then rinse the cloth well in clean water. You may use vinegar alone or oxalic
acid solution (1 teaspoon oxalic acid to 1 pint water) instead of the thiosulfate
solution, but they are not so satisfactory. To remove the stain completely you
may have to repeat the Javelle water-thiosulfate treatment several times.</p>
<p><b>Sodium perborate</b> is one of the safest bleaches for all types of materials.
The treatment must be rapid and the sodium perborate well rinsed from the
material, however, or it will take out the color. It will not remove some ink
stains, iron rust, dyes and running color, or metal stains.</p>
<p>For small, fresh stains, sponge with a liquid made up of 4 tablespoons sodium
perborate to 1 pint lukewarm water. Or stretch the stained cloth over a bowl
of hot water, dampen the stain with water, and dust the powdered sodium
perborate on it. Let stand a minute or two; then sponge or rinse well with
water.</p>
<p>For a large stain, soak the entire garment for a half hour or longer in sodium
perborate and soapsuds (4 tablespoons perborate to a pint of soapy water). To
remove grass, beverage, mud, scorch, and some perfume stains, mix 1 level
teaspoon sodium perborate with 1 pint hydrogen peroxide. But use this
mixture immediately, as it soon loses its strength. Rinse in water.</p>
<p>Sodium perborate is particularly good to use on white woolens; it leaves them
soft and fluffy.</p>
<p><b>Hydrogen peroxide</b>, obtained at drug stores, is a good bleach for light scorch
stains. The action of hydrogen peroxide is quicker if a few drops of ammonia
water are added just before use. Or you can add 1 level teaspoon of either borax
or sodium perborate to 1 pint of peroxide. Apply it to the stain with a medicine
dropper, a glass rod, or sponge the stain with it. Follow by careful sponging
or rinsing with water.</p>
<p><b>Oxalic acid is poisonous and should be handled carefully. Label it
&ldquo;Poison&rdquo; and keep it out of the reach of children.</b> Prepare a solution as
follows: Dissolve about 3 tablespoons of the crystals of the acid in a pint of
lukewarm water. Put in a bottle, stopper tightly, and use as needed. Stretch
the stained cloth over a bowl of clean water and apply the oxalic acid to the
stain with a medicine dropper or glass rod. Allow it to remain for a few minutes;
then rinse quickly by dipping in the water. Apply a weak solution of ammonia
water, borax, or sodium perborate to neutralize the action of the acid and rinse
again. Never use oxalic acid on weighted silk.</p>
<p><b>Hydrosulfites</b> are very useful to remove dye stains, iron rust, ink, mildew,
grass, and fruit stains. Sodium hydrosulfite, the one most often used, may be
bought at drug stores under many trade names as a dye or color remover for
preparing cloth for redyeing. It should be stored in a tightly closed can so it
will not become damp. To use, dissolve 2 teaspoons of the sodium hydrosulfite
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
in 1 pint of warm water and either sponge or dip the stained article in it. Or
sponge the stain with water first, sprinkle the powder on the stain, and work it
in well with the fingers. Rinse quickly. If used on colored material, hydrosulfites
are apt to remove the color; so apply the treatment quickly and rinse
well in water afterwards. Do not use on weighted silks.</p>
<h4>Pepsin and other enzymes</h4>
<p>Enzymes will remove certain stains from all kinds of materials. You can buy
pepsin, the best known of the enzymes, at the drug store. It softens stains
containing albumin (found in blood, gelatin, glues, certain
medicines, eggs, milk, and ice cream), so that they wash out in
water easily. Pepsin will soften these stains, even after they
have been set by heat or alcohol. First be sure there is no
soap or other alkali on the stain, or the enzyme will not react. Then dampen
the stain with lukewarm water and sprinkle with pepsin powder. Let it stand
for half an hour, keeping the spot damp. Or mix the pepsin with water (2
teaspoons to 1 pint lukewarm water) and sponge the stain with it. Sponge
or rinse well with water.</p>
<h4>Soaps and synthetic detergents</h4>
<p>Soaps and synthetic detergents (nonsoap cleaners) are helpful in removing
grease and food spots, blood, and many other stains. For washing silks and
woolens, select a mild soap. One with added alkaline salts may
cause the colors to run and the cloth to become stiff and harsh.
Also use a mild soap on all other delicate materials and on cotton,
especially on those that are not guaranteed colorfast. If
you are washing in hard water, add a water softener such as
one of the special phosphates&mdash;sodium hexametaphosphate or tetrasodium pyrophosphate
(sold under brand names)&mdash;which prevent the formation of hard-water
scum. This scum is caused by the reaction of the soap and the calcium and magnesium
compounds in the water. It settles on the clothes in gray or brown specks
that are hard to remove.</p>
<p>Synthetic detergents come in powder, paste, and liquid form. Most of them
suds and lather well, although a few clean without sudsing. They do not
make a scum with hard water.</p>
<p>Synthetic detergents, like soaps, may be mild or alkaline. The mild synthetics
are excellent for washing silks and fine fabrics, blankets, and sweaters. They
are relatively safe for colors. The alkaline synthetics, which contain alkaline
salts to aid in soil removal, are all-purpose washing agents for washing heavily
soiled garments.</p>
<p>The nonalkaline detergents can be used in place of glycerine to loosen fresh
tannin stains made by soft drinks and some fresh fruits. The other type should
not be used because alkali tends to set tannin stains. Soap, even the mild type,
is also alkaline enough to set these stains.</p>
<p>There are also special dry-cleaning soaps or benzene soaps, which, added to
dry-cleaning fluid, aid in softening the stain and removing the dirt. Or, to soften
a heavy grease or wax stain, put these soaps directly on the stain, especially on
silk and wool cloth. Then rinse well in carbon tetrachloride, Stoddard solvent,
gasoline, or benzene.</p>

<p>Keep all stain removers together on a handy shelf, but out of the reach of
children. Label all the jars and bottles; be sure to mark &ldquo;<i>Poison</i>&rdquo; plainly on the
poisonous ones. To have a complete shelf, you will need to keep at least three

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">Removing Individual Stains</span></h2>
<h3 class="center">Acids</h3>
<p>Act quickly when an acid has been spilled, for it may damage the cloth or
destroy the color. First, wash the stain with cold water to stop the action
of the acid. Rinse several times in cold water; then apply ammonia water or
baking soda. Water alone will not restore color, but ammonia water may.</p>
<p><b>Baking soda.</b>&mdash;Sprinkle soda on both sides of the stain, moisten with water,
and allow to stand until the bubbling stops. Rinse well with water.</p>
<p><b>Ammonia water.</b>&mdash;Hold the dampened stain over an open bottle of
strong ammonia water; or if the material doesn&rsquo;t water-spot, put a few drops
of ammonia water, diluted to half strength on the stain. Since ammonia water
affects some dyes, have white vinegar ready to apply quickly if the color changes.
Rinse well with water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Adhesive Tape</h3>
<p>Sponge or soak the stain in carbon tetrachloride, benzene, or kerosene. Kerosene
will make the cloth oily, so wash in warm suds after the treatment.</p>
<h3 class="center">Alcoholic Beverages and Soft Drinks</h3>
<p>Alcoholic beverages and soft drinks may cause tannin stains. Fresh tannin
stains are almost colorless, but if they are allowed to stand or are washed in
soap and water or heated as in ironing and pressing, they turn brown and are
almost impossible to remove. Fresh stains can be removed as follows:</p>
<p><b>Cold water and glycerine.</b>&mdash;Sponge the stain with water or with a mixture
of equal parts alcohol and water. Then pour glycerine on the stain and rub
between the hands. Let stand for a half hour and rinse with water.</p>
<p><b>Acetic acid.</b>&mdash;If the above treatment does not remove the stain, apply a
10-percent solution of acetic acid with a medicine dropper and let stand a few
seconds. Rinse and repeat if necessary. Stop the action of the acid with baking
soda or ammonia (see above) and spread the garment in the sun.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;The last traces of stains on white materials can sometimes be
removed by bleaching. Use one of the following:</p>
<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide or sodium perborate.</i>&mdash;Sponge lightly with hydrogen
peroxide or with a mixture of 1 level teaspoon sodium perborate to 1 pint
hydrogen peroxide. If this does not remove stain, cover dampened spot with
powdered sodium perborate and let stand an hour. Rinse in water.</p>
<p><i>Javelle water.</i>&mdash;For stains on uncolored cotton or linen material, dip in Javelle
water for 1 minute (no longer), remove the chlorine from the cloth with a
sodium thiosulfate solution, rinse well in water. (See <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a> for more detailed
instructions.) Do not use Javelle water to remove stains from colored materials
or from silk or wool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 class="center">Alkalies</h3>
<p>Remove alkali spots at once; they may destroy not only the color but the
material as well. First sponge or rinse the spot thoroughly with cold water.
This generally is sufficient for mild alkalies such as washing soda and weak
ammonia water. But to be on the safe side and to help restore color, apply
an acid&mdash;this stops the action of the alkali. Then rinse or sponge the spot
thoroughly with water. Use any of the following mild acids:</p>
<p><b>Lemon juice.</b>&mdash;Squeeze the juice on the stain, and allow it to remain until the
juice loses its bright yellow color. Sponge or rinse well with water.</p>
<p><b>Vinegar.</b>&mdash;Sponge with vinegar; then rinse in cold water.</p>
<p><b>Acetic acid.</b>&mdash;Apply a few drops of a 10-percent solution of acetic acid
with a medicine dropper or a glass rod and remove the excess by rinsing or
sponging with water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Argyrol</h3>
<p>Argyrol stains must be treated while still fresh. Proceed as follows:</p>
<p><b>Pepsin.</b>&mdash;Sponge with warm water to remove any argyrol that has not
soaked into the cloth. Then sprinkle powdered pepsin over the dampened
stain. Work it well into the cloth, let stand a half hour or longer, then sponge
with water.</p>
<p><b>Iodine and sodium thiosulfate (&ldquo;hypo&rdquo;).</b>&mdash;After the above treatment,
put a few drops of tincture of iodine on the dampened stain with a glass rod.
Let stand for 10 or 15 minutes; then sponge with a solution prepared by dissolving
several crystals of sodium thiosulfate in &frac12; cup of water. Rinse well in
water.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="576" />
<p class="pcap">To bring back the color
changed by an acid,
hold the dampened
stain in the fumes
from an open bottle
of ammonia water.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h3 class="center">Blood</h3>
<p>Blood stains will usually come out if sponged or washed in cold or lukewarm
water first. Never use hot water; it sets the stain.</p>
<p><b>Cold or lukewarm water.</b>&mdash;For stains on silk or wool, sponge with cold or
lukewarm water. For washable material, soak the stains in cold water until
they turn light brown in color; then wash in warm soapy water. If the stain
is an old one and has dried, it may help to add 2 tablespoons of ammonia water
to each gallon of water used for soaking. Strong salt water (about 2 cups of
salt to 1 gallon water) is also good to loosen the stain.</p>
<p><b>Hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.</b>&mdash;If the above treatment
does not completely remove the stain, sponge with hydrogen peroxide. Or
sponge with a mixture of 1 level teaspoon sodium perborate to 1 pint hydrogen
peroxide. If the stain still shows, cover the dampened spot with powdered
sodium perborate and let stand an hour. Rinse thoroughly. These bleaches will
not harm the cloth, but before using test for colorfastness on a sample of cloth
or on an inner seam of the garment. If the color fades, do not use the bleaches;
just dampen the stain and spread in the sun to bleach.</p>
<p><b>Starch.</b>&mdash;Use a starch paste to remove stains on thick materials, such as
flannel and blankets, which cannot be soaked in water. Mix raw starch to a
paste with cold water, apply the paste thickly to the stain, and brush it away
when it dries. Repeat the treatment until the stain disappears.</p>
<h3 class="center">Bluing</h3>
<p>Soak fresh stains or rinse them in cold water. Or wash the stained article
with plenty of warm soapy water, rubbing thoroughly.</p>
<h3 class="center">Candle Wax, Colored</h3>
<p>Scrape away as much wax as possible with a dull knife. Then treat as
follows:</p>
<p><b>Blotting paper.</b>&mdash;Place the stain between clean white blotters, cleansing
tissues, or paper towels, and press with a warm iron, changing the blotters as
they become soiled. Then sponge with carbon tetrachloride or other grease
solvent.</p>
<p><b>Denatured alcohol.</b>&mdash;If a color stain remains, sponge with liquid made up
of 1 cup denatured alcohol and 2 cups water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Candy</h3>
<p>Launder in warm soapy water if the material is washable. Otherwise,
sponge with clear warm water.</p>
<p>If dye or chocolate stains remain, follow instructions given under Dyes and
Running Colors, <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>, or Chocolate and Cocoa, <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3 class="center">Carbon Paper</h3>
<p>Carbon-paper stains usually can be removed by washing in a heavy suds of
soap and water. Sponge unwashable materials with a liquid of 1 cup alcohol
and 2 cups water; then sponge with cold water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Chewing Gum</h3>
<p>Use one of the following methods:</p>
<p><b>Ice.</b>&mdash;If the material will not water-spot, rub the gum stain with ice. Then
scrape and rub the hardened gum out of the cloth. This method is particularly
good for rugs and other heavy materials.</p>
<p><b>Egg white.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, soften the gum stain with egg white
and then wash.</p>
<p><b>Carbon tetrachloride, kerosene, or turpentine.</b>&mdash;Soak the stain in carbon
tetrachloride, kerosene, or turpentine. If kerosene is used, wash in warm
soapy water afterwards.</p>
<h3 class="center">Chocolate and Cocoa</h3>
<p>It may be necessary to try more than one method to remove chocolate and
cocoa stains, since they usually contain other substances such as fat, milk, starch,
and sugar. First scrape off as much of the stain as possible with a dull knife; then
try one of the following:</p>
<p><b>Soap and warm water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable the regular laundering
in warm soapy water will often remove this stain.</p>
<p><b>Hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.</b>&mdash;Sponge stubborn stains
with hydrogen peroxide. Or use a mixture of 1 level teaspoon sodium perborate
to 1 pint hydrogen peroxide. If the stain still shows, cover the dampened
spot with powdered sodium perborate and let stand an hour. Rinse thoroughly.
Be sure to test for color change on a sample of the cloth or on the inside
of hem or seam of the garment before using these bleaches on the stain.</p>
<p><b>Carbon tetrachloride and pepsin.</b>&mdash;If the cloth is not washable sponge
with carbon tetrachloride to dissolve the grease. Dry thoroughly, then sponge
with warm water, and dust with pepsin powder. Work the powder into the
cloth, let stand for 30 minutes or longer, then sponge with water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Cod-liver Oil</h3>
<p>Fresh cod-liver oil stains are almost colorless and are easy to remove. But
old stains, especially if the material has been washed or ironed, are a light brown
and are almost impossible to remove, even with bleaches. Treat fresh stains
with either of the following:</p>
<p><b>Grease solvents.</b>&mdash;Sponge or dip fresh cod-liver oil stains in carbon tetrachloride,
benzene, Stoddard solvent, or gasoline. When the cod-liver oil has
been removed, sponge with warm soapy water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p><b>Glycerine.</b>&mdash;For washable materials, pour either glycerine or one of the
soapless shampoos on the fresh stain. Rub lightly between the hands to loosen
the stain, rinse well in water, and then wash in warm soapsuds.</p>
<h3 class="center">Coffee and Tea</h3>
<p><b>Water and glycerine.</b>&mdash;If the stains are on wool or silk, sponge with lukewarm
water. Then apply glycerine and rub lightly between the hands. Let
stand for half an hour and rinse thoroughly with water. If a grease spot from
cream remains, sponge with carbon tetrachloride.</p>
<p><b>Boiling water.</b>&mdash;Remove fresh stains from washable materials by pouring
boiling water on the stain from a height of 2 or 3 feet, then wash in warm soapy
water. If a trace of stain remains, dry in the sun or bleach with hydrogen
peroxide and sodium perborate.</p>
<p><b>Hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.</b>&mdash;Sponge with clear water and
then with a solution of 1 teaspoon sodium perborate to 1 pint hydrogen peroxide.
If the stain still shows, sprinkle powdered sodium perborate on the stain and
let stand half an hour. Rinse well with water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Dyes and Running Colors</h3>
<p>As there are many different kinds of dyes, no one remover will successfully
take out all dye stains. In fact, it may be impossible to remove some of these
stains completely. Proceed as follows:</p>
<p><b>Water and sunlight.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, rinse the stains in cold or
lukewarm water (soak for 10 to 12 hours if necessary), wash in heavy soapsuds,
and then dry in the sun. Spots on wool or silk materials sometimes come out
by soaking or washing in cold water.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;If a stain remains, try one of the following:</p>
<p><i>Hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;Apply one of the hydrosulfites available at drug stores as a
color remover. Follow directions on the package.</p>
<p><i>Javelle water.</i>&mdash;For stains on uncolored linen, cotton, or rayon, dip in Javelle
water for 1 minute (no longer), remove the chlorine from the cloth with a
sodium thiosulfate solution, rinse well in water. (See <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a> for more detailed
instructions.) Do not use Javelle water to remove stains from silk or wool.</p>
<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide.</i>&mdash;For stains on any white material, add a few drops of
ammonia water to hydrogen peroxide. Soak the stains until they disappear and
rinse thoroughly in water. One teaspoon sodium perborate added to 1 pint
hydrogen peroxide makes a good bleach, but it must be made fresh, as it soon
loses its strength.</p>
<h3 class="center">Egg</h3>
<p>Scrape away as much of the stain as possible with a blunt knife. Then sponge
with cold water. Never use hot water&mdash;heat makes egg stains harder to remove.</p>
<p><b>Pepsin.</b>&mdash;If cold water does not remove the stain completely, sprinkle pepsin
powder over the spot. Work it in well and let stand for half an hour. Rinse
well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p><b>Grease solvents.</b>&mdash;For nonwashable materials, sponge first with cold
water. Let dry and then sponge with carbon tetrachloride, gasoline, or other
grease solvent.</p>
<h3 class="center">Fingernail Polish</h3>
<p><b>Acetone or nail-polish removers.</b>&mdash;On any material except acetate rayon
or vinyon, sponge the stain with acetone or a commercial nail-polish remover.</p>
<p><b>Grease solvent and banana oil (amyl acetate).</b>&mdash;Use this treatment on
any material including acetate rayon and vinyon. First wet the stain well with
carbon tetrachloride or gasoline; then apply a drop of banana oil to the stain.
Brush lightly with a soft cloth, using an upward motion to pick up the dissolved
polish. For heavy stains use dry-cleaning soap with the banana oil.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;To remove any color remaining after the polish itself has been
dissolved, apply a bleach. Test the cloth for change in color first.</p>
<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.</i>&mdash;Sponge with clear water and then
with a solution of 1 teaspoon sodium perborate to 1 pint hydrogen peroxide.
If the stain still shows, sprinkle powdered sodium perborate on the stain and
let stand half an hour. Rinse well with clear water.</p>
<p><i>Hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;Apply one of the hydrosulfites available at drug stores as a
color remover. Follow directions on the package.</p>
<h3 class="center">Fish Slime</h3>
<p>Soak or sponge the stain with a solution made of &frac12; cup salt and 1 cup vinegar
in 2 quarts of water. Rinse well in water; then wash in warm soapsuds.</p>
<h3 class="center">Flypaper, Sticky</h3>
<p>Sponge the stain with carbon tetrachloride or benzene. If the material is
washable, soak in kerosene and then wash in warm soapy water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Fruits and Berries</h3>
<p>Treat fruit and berry stains immediately, if possible; they are hard to remove
after they dry. Boiling water (if it does not harm the cloth) or sometimes even
warm water will remove most fruit stains. It is better not to use soap, as
alkalies set some fruit and berry stains. Use the same methods for removing
stains from cooked fruits and berries as from fresh.</p>
<p>Washing in warm soapy water sometimes removes stains from citrus fruits,
such as grapefruit and lemon. But if the stain is old or the cloth has been pressed
before washing, use one of the bleaches described below. If the acid in citrus
fruit changes the color of the cloth, restore it with ammonia water or baking
soda. (See Acids, <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Cold water and glycerine.</b>&mdash;For fresh peach, pear, cherry, and plum stains
on cotton and linen and for any fruit stain on wool or silk materials (either white
or colored), first sponge the stain well with cool water; then work glycerine or
a soapless shampoo into the stain, rubbing lightly between the hands. Do not
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
use soap, as soap sets the stain. Let stand several hours, then apply a few drops
of vinegar or oxalic acid, allow to remain for a minute or two, then rinse
thoroughly in water.</p>
<p><b>Boiling water.</b>&mdash;Boiling water removes from cotton and linen most fruit
stains except peach, pear, plum, and cherry. Never use boiling water on silk
or wool. Stretch the stained part over a bowl, fasten it with string, and pour
boiling water on it from a teakettle held at a height of 3 or 4 feet so that the water
strikes the stain with force. Rubbing alternated with the boiling water is also
helpful. If a stain remains, squeeze a little lemon juice on it and place in the
sun to dry, or use one of the chemical bleaches.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;If a stain remains, try one of the following:</p>
<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.</i>&mdash;Sponge with hydrogen peroxide-sodium
perborate mixture (1 teaspoon sodium perborate to 1 pint peroxide).
Rinse thoroughly. If the stain persists, sprinkle powdered sodium perborate
on the dampened area and let stand for half an hour. Finally rinse well. Always
test for change of color on the inside of a hem or seam before using these bleaches.
If the color fades, do not use them&mdash;just dampen the stain with water and
spread in the sun to bleach.</p>
<p><i>Hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;Hydrosulfites available at drug stores as dye removers are
satisfactory for removing fruit stains from any white material. Follow directions
on package.</p>
<p><i>Javelle water.</i>&mdash;For stains on uncolored linen or cotton material, dip in Javelle
water for 1 minute (no longer), remove the chlorine from the cloth with a
sodium thiosulfate solution, rinse well in water. (See <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a> for more detailed
instructions.) Do not use Javelle water on silk or wool.</p>
<h3 class="center">Glue and Mucilage</h3>
<p><b>Water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, soak the spot in warm water, or if it is a
stubborn stain you may have to boil it. If the stain is known to be casein glue,
soak it in cold water.</p>
<p><b>Acetic acid.</b>&mdash;For nonwashable materials, sponge the spot with water, then
with acetic acid (10-percent solution) or white vinegar. Rinse well.</p>
<h3 class="center">Grass and Other Fresh Garden Foliage</h3>
<p><b>Hot water and soap.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, use hot water and soap,
rubbing the stain well. If this does not completely remove the stain, use a
bleach.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;Try one of the following:</p>
<p><i>Javelle water.</i>&mdash;For stains on uncolored linen, cotton, or rayon, dip in Javelle
water for 1 minute (no longer), remove the chlorine from the cloth with a
sodium thiosulfate solution, rinse well in water. (See <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a> for more detailed
instructions.) Do not use Javelle water to remove stains from silk or wool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.</i>&mdash;Sponge with clear water and then
with a solution of 1 teaspoon sodium perborate to 1 pint hydrogen peroxide.
If the stain still shows, sprinkle powdered sodium perborate on the stain and
let stand half an hour. Rinse well with clear water. Always test for change
of color on a sample of the cloth before using these bleaches.</p>
<p><i>Hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;Hydrosulfites available at drug stores as dye removers are
satisfactory in removing grass stains from any white materials. Follow directions
on the package.</p>
<p><b>Benzene or denatured alcohol.</b>&mdash;On materials that soap and water might
injure, sponge the stains with benzene or alcohol. Test them first to be sure
they do not change the color of the material. Do not use alcohol on acetate
rayon or vinyon unless you dilute it&mdash;1 cup denatured alcohol with 2 cups water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Grease and Oils</h3>
<p>Fresh grease spots usually are the pure fat or oil. Old grease spots or stains
from automobile, wheel, or machine greases usually contain also more or less
dust, dirt, or fine bits of metal. (For road oil and axle grease, see <a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>.) First
scrape or wipe off as much of the grease as possible; then treat the stain by one
of the following methods:</p>
<p><b>Soap and water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, wash in warm sudsy water.
Be sure to use plenty of soap on the stained part and rub well between the hands.
The soaplike washing agents (soapless shampoos, oils, and lathers) are good to
soften grease stains.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="319" />
<p class="pcap">Place a grease or oil stain between paper towels or cleansing tissues and
press with a warm iron.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Absorbents.</b>&mdash;Use cornstarch, French chalk, or white talcum powder for
fine materials; corn meal or salt for carpets, rugs, and other coarse materials.
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Dust the powder or salt over the spot, let stand until it absorbs the grease or
oil, then brush off. Another method is to place the stained part between blotting
papers and press lightly with a warm iron. Change the blotting paper as it
becomes soiled. Or use cleansing tissues or paper towels in the same way.
The advantage of using absorbents is that they do not wet the material or leave
rings as water or grease solvents are apt to do.</p>
<p><b>Grease solvents.</b>&mdash;Remove common grease and oils with carbon tetrachloride,
gasoline, or benzene. Place a pad of clean cloth or a white blotter
beneath the stain and sponge with a clean cloth, moistened with the grease solvent.
Work from the wrong side of the material in order to push the dirt and
grease out rather than to rub it into the material. Use light, brushing motions,
work from the outside of the spot toward the center and spread or &ldquo;feather out&rdquo;
the solvent into the cloth around the stain until there is no definite edge. Then
pat dry with a clean, dry cloth.</p>
<p>If the grease spot contains dirt or fine bits of metal, first loosen the stain by
rubbing a little lard, petroleum jelly, or dry-cleaning soap into it. Then sponge
with the grease solvent or dip the stain into a small bowl of the solvent.</p>
<p>Another method is to make a paste by mixing cornstarch or talcum with
carbon tetrachloride or other dry-cleaning fluid. Spread the paste over the spot;
when dry brush it off. Repeat if necessary. The solvent does not spread and
is less likely to form a ring if used in this way.</p>
<h3 class="center">Ice Cream</h3>
<p>Ice cream stains contain milk or cream, sugar, sometimes egg, and often coloring.
If after trying the following methods, a fruit or chocolate stain remains,
follow instructions under Fruits and Berries, <a href="#Page_15">page 15</a>, or under Chocolate and
Cocoa, <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>.</p>
<p><b>Cold or lukewarm water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable and the stain contains
no highly colored fruit or chocolate, sponge with cold or lukewarm water;
then wash in warm soapsuds.</p>
<p><b>Carbon tetrachloride.</b>&mdash;For nonwashable materials, sponge with carbon
tetrachloride to remove the greasy part of the stain. Let it dry; then sponge
with cold water to remove any stains from the egg and sugar in the ice cream.
If this does not remove the stain completely, follow with a pepsin treatment.</p>
<p><b>Pepsin.</b>&mdash;First sponge the stain with cold water, then sprinkle pepsin
on the dampened stain, and let it stand half an hour. Brush it off and rinse the
spot well. For best results, be sure the material is free from soap or other alkali
before applying the pepsin.</p>
<h3 class="center">Ink</h3>
<p>Because inks differ in composition, it is impossible to find removers that are
equally effective for all types of ink spots. Each of the methods mentioned
below is satisfactory with some type of ink. For most ink spots, it is necessary
to try several methods, beginning always with the simplest and that least
likely to harm the cloth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h4>India or drawing ink</h4>
<p><b>Denatured alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, and benzene.</b>&mdash;Place a pad
of cloth or blotter under the stain and sponge with one of these solvents. Then
rub glycerine (use glycerine only with alcohol) or a dry-cleaning soap into the
stain and finally rinse out with the solvent. If this does not remove the stain,
let the stain dry; then wet with water and rub in a synthetic detergent (nonsoap
cleaner) to help soften the stain. Or use strong soapsuds to which a few drops
of ammonia water have been added. Alcohol must not be used on acetate rayon
or colored materials.</p>
<h4>Printing ink</h4>
<p>Use one of the following agents for removing printing-ink stains:</p>
<p><b>Lard or petroleum jelly.</b>&mdash;Rub the stain with lard or petroleum jelly;
work it into the cloth. If material is washable, wash with soap and water;
otherwise sponge with carbon tetrachloride, gasoline, or other grease solvent.</p>
<p><b>Turpentine.</b>&mdash;Soak the stain for a few minutes in turpentine and then
sponge with carbon tetrachloride, alcohol, or other dry-cleaning fluid. Do not
use alcohol on acetate rayon or colored materials.</p>
<p><b>Kerosene.</b>&mdash;To remove printing from flour bags and other bags, soak in
kerosene for several hours. Then wash thoroughly in soap and hot water and
spread on the grass in the sun to dry.</p>
<h4>Writing ink</h4>
<p>In removing writing-ink stains it usually is necessary to try various methods.
Always start with the simplest method and the one least likely to harm the cloth.</p>
<p><b>Absorbents.</b>&mdash;If the stain is still wet, spread corn meal, salt, French chalk,
cornstarch, or talcum powder on the stain to remove any excess ink and to keep
it from spreading. Work the powder into the stain. Shake it off as it becomes
soiled and repeat the process. When the dry absorbent fails to take up more
ink, make the absorbent into a paste with water or with a mixture of 1 part
water and 1 part alcohol and apply again. Let dry and brush off.</p>
<p><b>Glycerine and water or soap and water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable,
pour either glycerine or one of the soapless shampoos on the fresh stain. Rub
lightly between the hands, rinse, and apply glycerine again as long as any ink
comes from the stain. Rinse with clear water. Washing with soap and warm
water will remove some types of ink.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;If the above treatments do not remove the stain, try a bleach.
But use bleaches sparingly on colored materials.</p>
<p><i>Oxalic acid.</i>&mdash;Soak the stain for a few seconds in a solution of oxalic acid
(3 tablespoons of the crystals of the acid to a pint of water). Or sponge the
stain well with cold water, then stretch the stain over a bowl of hot water,
and apply crystals of oxalic acid directly to the stain. Rinse by dipping in the
hot water and finally in water to which a few drops of ammonia water have
been added. Do not use on weighted silk.</p>
<p><i>Hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;Sponge with a hydrosulfite solution and rinse quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h3 class="center">Iodine</h3>
<p><b>Soap and water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, soap and water will often
remove a fresh stain. Or moisten with water and place either in the sun, over
a warm radiator, or hold in the steam from a boiling teakettle.</p>
<p><b>Denatured alcohol.</b>&mdash;On materials that water would injure, sponge with
alcohol. On acetate rayon and colored materials be sure to dilute the alcohol&mdash;1
cup denatured alcohol to 2 cups water.</p>
<p><b>Sodium thiosulfate (&ldquo;hypo&rdquo;).</b>&mdash;Sponge the stain or dip in a solution of 1
tablespoon of the &ldquo;hypo&rdquo; to 1 pint of water. Rinse well in water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Iron Rust</h3>
<p>Use any of the methods given below to remove iron-rust stains from white
materials. Test remover on sample of cloth before using on colored materials.</p>
<p><b>Lemon juice.</b>&mdash;Spread the stain over a pan of boiling water and then squeeze
lemon juice on it. After a few minutes rinse; then repeat the process. This
method is rather slow, but does not harm delicate white cottons or linens.
Another method is to sprinkle the stain with salt, squeeze lemon juice on it,
and spread in the sun to dry. Add more lemon juice if the stain still shows.
Rinse well.</p>
<p><b>Oxalic acid.</b>&mdash;Spread the stained article over a bowl of hot water and apply
a few drops of oxalic acid solution (3 tablespoons of the crystals to 1 pint of
water). Or put the crystals of acid directly on the stain and moisten with hot
water. Rinse in hot water, and repeat until the stain disappears. Do not use
on weighted silk.</p>
<p><b>Cream of tartar.</b>&mdash;Boil the stained article in a liquid made up of 4 teaspoons
of cream of tartar to 1 pint of water. Rinse thoroughly.</p>
<p><b>Hydrosulfite.</b>&mdash;Hydrosulfites available at drug stores as color removers or
dye-stripping agents also will remove rust stains. Follow directions given on
the package. Do not use on weighted silks.</p>
<h3 class="center">Linseed Oil</h3>
<p>Sponge with carbon tetrachloride or benzene. Treat as for cod-liver oil
stains.</p>
<h3 class="center">Lipstick and Rouge</h3>
<p><b>Petroleum jelly and carbon tetrachloride.</b>&mdash;If water spots the cloth,
work petroleum jelly or lard into the stain. Then either sponge with carbon
tetrachloride or dip the stained part in a bowl of the solvent. If a trace of color
remains, sponge with denatured alcohol. On acetate rayon and colored materials,
dilute the alcohol&mdash;1 cup of denatured alcohol to 2 cups water.</p>
<p><b>Glycerine, soap, and water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, first loosen the
stain as above with glycerine or petroleum jelly. Then launder. If soap or
other alkalies are applied before the stain is loosened, they are apt to set it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p><b>Hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.</b>&mdash;Sponge with sodium perborate-hydrogen
peroxide mixture (1 teaspoon sodium perborate to 1 pint
peroxide). Rinse thoroughly. If the stain persists, sprinkle powdered sodium
perborate on the dampened area and let stand for half an hour. Finally rinse
well. Be sure to test the cloth for colorfastness before using these bleaches.</p>
<h3 class="center">Meat Juice or Gravy</h3>
<p>Sponge meat-juice or gravy stains with cold or lukewarm water. Never use
hot water; it sets the stain. If a grease spot remains, launder washable materials
in warm soapy water. If the cloth is not washable, use an absorbent powder or a
grease solvent.</p>
<p><b>Absorbents.</b>&mdash;Dust the powder over the stain, let it stand until it absorbs
the grease, then brush off.</p>
<p><b>Solvents.</b>&mdash;Sponge with carbon tetrachloride, gasoline, or benzene.</p>
<h3 class="center">Medicines</h3>
<p>Because of the great number and variety of substances used in medicines, it is
not possible to give methods for removing all such stains. If you know what the
medicine is made of, it will aid in choosing the remover. For instance, a tarry
or gummy medicine can be treated in the same way as a tar spot (see <a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>); a
medicine containing much iron can be removed in the same way as iron rust
(see <a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>). Medicines in a sugar sirup usually can be washed out with water;
those dissolved in alcohol sometimes can be removed by sponging the stain with
alcohol. Many of the medicines used in swabbing sore throats contain silver
nitrate and should be sponged with a solution of sodium thiosulfate (&ldquo;hypo&rdquo;)&mdash;1
teaspoon of the crystals in 1 cup of water.</p>
<p>If you cannot find out what kind of medicine caused the stain, you may have
to try several methods to find one that will do the job. Each of the following
methods will remove certain medicine stains.</p>
<p><b>Boiling water.</b>&mdash;For washable materials, pour boiling water on the stain
from a height of 3 or 4 feet, as for fruit stains, or launder in warm soapy water.</p>
<p><b>Denatured alcohol or carbon tetrachloride.</b>&mdash;Some color stains can be
sponged or soaked out with alcohol. Sponge greasy stains with carbon tetrachloride.
A dry-cleaning soap helps to loosen them. Finally sponge with fresh
carbon tetrachloride.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;Use bleaches only on white materials. Try one of the following:</p>
<p><i>Hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;Use one of the hydrosulfite dye-stripping agents available at
drug stores. Follow instructions on the package.</p>
<p><i>Javelle water.</i>&mdash;For stains on linen, cotton, or rayon, dip in Javelle water for
1 minute (no longer), remove the chlorine from the cloth with a sodium thiosulfate
solution, rinse well in water. (See <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a> for more detailed instructions.)
Do not use Javelle water on silk or wool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h3 class="center">Mercurochrome</h3>
<p>Mercurochrome stains are very hard to remove unless you treat them promptly.
Proceed as follows:</p>
<p><b>Denatured alcohol, glycerine, and laundering.</b>&mdash;First sponge the stain
well with a liquid made of equal parts of alcohol and water. (On acetate rayon
and colored materials use 1 part alcohol and 2 parts water). Next work glycerine
into the cloth to help loosen the stain, and continue using as long as any color
bleeds from the stain. Then wash well in soapsuds, and rinse with water to
which a few drops of ammonia water have been added.</p>
<p><b>Acetic acid.</b>&mdash;If a stain remains after the above treatment, apply 10-percent
acetic acid with a medicine dropper; then rinse well in water.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;If the above treatments do not completely remove the stain, use
a bleach.</p>
<p><i>Javelle water.</i>&mdash;For stains on uncolored linen, cotton, or rayon, dip in Javelle
water for 1 minute (no longer), remove the chlorine from the cloth with a
sodium thiosulfate solution, rinse well in water. (See <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a> for more detailed
instructions.) Do not use Javelle water on silk or wool.</p>
<p><i>Sodium perborate.</i>&mdash;Sponge with a sodium perborate solution (4 tablespoons
of the perborate in a pint of lukewarm water) or dampen the stain with water
and dust the powdered sodium perborate on it. Rinse thoroughly. Always
test for the effect on the color of the cloth before using bleaches.</p>
<p><i>Sodium hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;This color remover is available at drug stores. It may
be used safely on most white materials. Follow directions on the package.</p>
<h3 class="center">Metallic Stains</h3>
<p>The tarnish of copper, brass, tin, and other metals often stains textiles. To
remove, apply vinegar, lemon juice, or a 10-percent solution of acetic acid.
Rinse well as soon as the stain has dissolved. Do not use chlorine bleaches or
sodium perborate to remove these stains.</p>
<p>Mercury or quicksilver removes lead or solder stains from rugs or clothing.
First scrape off as much of the lead as possible with a dull knife. Then pour
mercury on the stain and work with a stick until the mercury absorbs the stains.</p>
<h3 class="center">Mildew</h3>
<p>Mildew spots must be treated when fresh, before the mold growth has a
chance to weaken the cloth.</p>
<p><b>Soap and water.</b>&mdash;On washable material, soap and water will remove very
fresh stains. Drying on the grass in the sun helps to bleach the spots.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;Try a bleaching agent if soap and water do not remove the stain.
Be sure to test for colorfastness on a hidden part of the garment.</p>
<p><i>Lemon juice.</i>&mdash;Moisten the stain with lemon juice and salt and place in the
sun. This often removes slight stains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p><i>Javelle water.</i>&mdash;Old stains on cotton, linen, or rayon may be bleached out with
Javelle water. Dip the stain in the Javelle water for 1 minute (no longer),
remove the chlorine from the cloth with a sodium thiosulphate solution, rinse
well in water. (See <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a> for more detailed instructions.) Do not use Javelle
water on silk or wool.</p>
<p><i>Sodium perborate.</i>&mdash;Soak the stain in a sodium perborate solution (4 tablespoons
perborate to 1 pint lukewarm water). Or dampen the stain with water
and sprinkle the perborate powder directly on the stain. Rinse after either
treatment.</p>
<h3 class="center">Milk and Cream</h3>
<p>See Ice Cream, <a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>.</p>
<h3 class="center">Mimeograph-Correction Fluid</h3>
<p>Follow instructions given under Fingernail Polish, <a href="#Page_15">page 15</a>.</p>
<h3 class="center">Mucus</h3>
<p>Soak in lukewarm salt water (about 2 cups salt to 1 gallon water) or in weak
ammonia water (2 tablespoons ammonia water to each gallon water). Rinse
well with cold water and launder as usual.</p>
<h3 class="center">Mud</h3>
<p>Let the mud stain dry, then brush well. Sponge with clear water, or use
soap and water if it will not harm the cloth. Sponging with alcohol will help
to remove the last traces of the stain. On colored materials and acetate rayon
dilute the alcohol&mdash;1 cup denatured alcohol to 2 cups water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Mustard</h3>
<p><b>Glycerine and soap and water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, work glycerine
into the stain, rub lightly between the hands, and then wash the article in
soap and water.</p>
<p><b>Denatured alcohol.</b>&mdash;If water spots the cloth, sponge the stain with alcohol.
Since alcohol makes some colors run, test a sample of the cloth to be sure it
does not harm the color. On acetate rayon sponge with dilute alcohol&mdash;1 cup
denatured alcohol to 2 cups water.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;Try one of the following, but use sparingly on colored materials
and do not use on weighted silks.</p>
<p><i>Hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;Sponge with a hydrosulfite solution (2 teaspoons in 1 pint of
warm water) and rinse quickly.</p>
<p><i>Oxalic acid.</i>&mdash;Apply oxalic acid solution with a medicine dropper (see <a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>)
and rinse well with clear water. Sponge with weak ammonia water, borax
or sodium perborate solution, to neutralize the acid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h3 class="center">Paints&mdash;Oil Paints, Varnishes, Enamels</h3>
<p>Treat oil paint, varnish, and enamel stains quickly, since a dried or hardened
paint stain is almost impossible to remove. Scrape off as much of the paint or
varnish as possible before using any remover. If the stain has hardened, apply
a solvent on both sides and give time for it to soften. Do not rub too hard;
rubbing roughens the cloth. Use one of the following methods:</p>
<p><b>Soap and water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, remove fresh stains by washing
with plenty of soap. If the stain has dried, soften it first by rubbing oil,
lard, or petroleum jelly into it.</p>
<p><b>Turpentine or other solvents.</b>&mdash;Sponge the stain with pure turpentine or,
if the spots are large or scattered, wash the whole article in it. Or soak in a
liquid of equal parts ammonia water and turpentine, rinse several times in fresh
turpentine, wash in soapy water. Carbon tetrachloride, kerosene, alcohol, or
benzene may be applied in the same way as turpentine. Benzene is good for the
usual type of spar varnish. Alcohol will remove stains of shellac varnish, but
never use alcohol on acetate rayon or vinyon.</p>
<p><b>Paint and varnish remover.</b>&mdash;Equal parts of benzene, carbon tetrachloride,
and amyl acetate (banana oil) make a very good paint remover. Apply
the remover and rub in a dry-cleaning soap to help loosen the stain. Finally
rinse out with carbon tetrachloride.</p>
<h3 class="center">Pencil Marks</h3>
<h4>Indelible pencil</h4>
<p>Do not use water on indelible pencil marks as this spreads the dye and makes
the stain harder to remove. Use one of the following:</p>
<p><b>Denatured alcohol.</b>&mdash;Soak the stain in alcohol. If carbon marks remain,
sponge with soap and water. Do not use alcohol on acetate rayon. Test all
dyed cloth for colorfastness.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;Remove the dye with a bleaching agent.</p>
<p><i>Javelle water.</i>&mdash;For stains on uncolored cotton, linen, or rayon, dip in Javelle
water for 1 minute (no longer), remove the chlorine from the cloth with a
sodium thiosulfate solution, rinse well in water. (See <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a> for more detailed
instructions.) Do not use Javelle water on silk or wool.</p>
<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.</i>&mdash;For other materials sponge with a
mixture of 1 teaspoon sodium perborate to 1 pint peroxide. Rinse well.</p>
<h4>Lead pencil</h4>
<p>A soft eraser sometimes will remove the marks, especially on stiff or starched
materials. If the material is washable, rub soapsuds into the stain and launder
as usual. Sponge woolen materials with clear water or with a solution of equal
parts alcohol and water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h3 class="center">Perspiration Stains</h3>
<p>Perspiration of the body is usually acid, so you can sometimes restore colors
changed by a perspiration stain by treating with an alkali. Dampen the stain
with water and hold it over the fumes from an open ammonia water bottle.
(See Acids, <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>.) Old stains may be alkaline; then try vinegar. (See Alkalies,
<a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>.) However, colors changed by perspiration cannot always be restored,
particularly if the stain is an old one.</p>
<p>To remove perspiration odors, sponge the stained part with warm water to
which a few drops of vinegar have been added, sprinkle powdered pepsin over
the stain, work it well into the cloth, and let stand 1 to 2 hours, keeping the
spot moist. Then brush off the powder and rinse well.</p>
<p>Yellowish perspiration stains on white material can be removed by:</p>
<p><b>Soap and water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, bleach in the sun after washing
in soap and water.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;For a stubborn stain, try a bleach.</p>
<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide.</i>&mdash;Sponge with hydrogen peroxide or a mixture of 1 teaspoon
sodium perborate to 1 pint peroxide. Rinse with water.</p>
<p><i>Sodium hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;Quickly dip the stain into a sodium hydrosulfite solution
(2 teaspoons sodium hydrosulfite to 1 pint water). Rinse immediately.
First test the colorfastness of the cloth to this bleach.</p>
<h3 class="center">Rubber Cement</h3>
<p>To remove rubber cement either sponge or dip the cloth in carbon tetrachloride,
Stoddard solvent, gasoline, or benzene. If the stain has dried, rub in
petroleum jelly or dry-cleaning soap to loosen it. Then apply the carbon tetrachloride
or other solvent.</p>
<h3 class="center">Salad Dressings</h3>
<p>The acid of the vinegar or lemon juice in salad dressings may injure the color
of the material. Apply a mild alkali such as baking soda or weak ammonia
water immediately to restore the color. (See Acids, <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>.) Then use one of
the following to remove the stain:</p>
<p><b>Soap and water.</b>&mdash;Sponge delicate, washable materials with lukewarm water.
Do not use hot water if egg or cream was used in making the salad dressing. Use
soap if it will not harm the cloth.</p>
<p><b>Grease solvents.</b>&mdash;Sponge the stain with lukewarm water, let dry, and then
sponge with carbon tetrachloride, Stoddard solvent, gasoline, or benzene.</p>
<p><b>Absorbents.</b>&mdash;Absorbent powders are particularly good for splatters of
salad oil. Dust cornstarch or talcum powder over the spot, allow it to absorb
the oil or grease, then brush off. Or make a thick paste by mixing the powder
with carbon tetrachloride or other grease solvent, spread it on the spot, let
dry, and brush off. Repeat if necessary. Another method is to put the stained
cloth between cleansing tissues and press with a warm iron.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h3 class="center">Scorch</h3>
<p>You can usually remove light scorch stains from cotton and linen materials,
but wool and silk can seldom be restored to their original condition. Brushing
with emery paper may improve wool, however. Try the following:</p>
<p><b>Soap and water.</b>&mdash;If the cloth is washable, soap and water will remove very
slight stains. After washing, place the article in the sun for a day or two;
it may bleach out any remaining traces of the stain.</p>
<p><b>Hydrogen peroxide.</b>&mdash;If the stained material is white, use hydrogen peroxide.
Dampen a white cotton cloth with the peroxide and lay it on the stain.
Cover with a clean dry cloth; then press with a medium warm iron. If the
hydrogen peroxide soaks through the top cloth, replace with a dry one. Ironing
directly on the cloth moistened with peroxide or on the dampened stain itself,
after the cloth has been removed, will cause rust stains on the garment.
Repeat the treatment, until the stain is completely removed. Rinse well.</p>
<p>Light scorch stains may be removed also by sponging with hydrogen peroxide
to which sodium perborate has been added (1 teaspoon sodium perborate to 1
pint peroxide). Rinse well with water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Shoe Dressings</h3>
<p><b>Soap and water.</b>&mdash;If the material is washable, remove fresh stains from one
of the paste dressings by sponging or washing thoroughly with plenty of soap.
For spots caused by white dressings, sponge first with water, then with soap and
water.</p>
<p><b>Solvents.</b>&mdash;Sponge well with carbon tetrachloride or turpentine. Glycerine,
lard, or petroleum jelly worked into the stain first helps to loosen it. For liquid
dressings and for stains on wool, sponge with denatured alcohol. Do not use
alcohol on acetate rayon or colored cloth.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;If a dye stain remains, remove with a bleaching agent.</p>
<p><i>Hydrosulfite.</i>&mdash;Apply one of the hydrosulfites available at drug stores as a
color remover. Follow directions on the package.</p>
<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide or sodium perborate.</i>&mdash;Sponge the stain with hydrogen
peroxide or with a sodium perborate solution (<a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>) or sprinkle sodium perborate
powder on the moistened stain directly. Rinse well.</p>
<h3 class="center">Soap</h3>
<p>Ironing material from which the soap has not been well rinsed may cause a
stain much like iron rust. Washing with soap and water usually removes it.
Be sure to rinse well. Bleaching in the sun afterwards is sometimes helpful.</p>
<h3 class="center">Soot and Smoke</h3>
<p><b>Absorbents with solvents.</b>&mdash;First brush the stain; then sprinkle with an
absorbent powder&mdash;French chalk, cornstarch, corn meal, or salt. Work the
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
powder around until soiled and brush it off. Then if the material is washable,
sponge or wash with soap and water. If water harms the cloth, first use an
absorbent; then sponge the stain with one of the grease solvents&mdash;carbon
tetrachloride, Stoddard solvent, or gasoline.</p>
<p>Another method is to make a paste by mixing an absorbent powder with
carbon tetrachloride or other solvent, spread it on the stain, then brush it off
when dry.</p>
<p>To remove the odor of smoke from a garment, have it dry-cleaned.</p>
<h3 class="center">Sugar Sirups</h3>
<p>If the material is washable, wash out sugar-sirup stains with soap and water.
For more delicate materials, sponge with clean water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Tar, Road Oil, Asphalt, Axle Grease, Pitch</h3>
<p>Stains made by tarlike substances are hard to remove, especially from cotton
material. First rub in petroleum jelly or lard to soften the stain, then sponge
with one of the grease solvents&mdash;carbon tetrachloride, Stoddard solvent, gasoline,
benzene&mdash;or dip the article in the liquid and rub lightly between the hands.
Repeat the treatment until the stain is removed. If the material is washable, use
warm soapy water after rubbing in the petroleum jelly or lard.</p>
<p>For stains on carpets or rugs, scrape off as much as possible with a dull knife.
Then sponge with the grease solvent, using a brushing motion so that you do
not rub the stain into the carpet.</p>
<h3 class="center">Tobacco</h3>
<p>Treat stains from the tarry substances in the stem of a pipe in the same way
as tar. Use one of the following methods to remove tobacco juice stains:</p>
<p><b>Cold water and glycerine.</b>&mdash;Sponge with cold water; then work warm
glycerine into the stain. Let stand for half an hour, and wash with soap and
water. If the stain cannot be completely removed by washing, bleach it in the
sun. Moistening it with lemon juice makes it disappear more quickly.</p>
<p><b>Wood or denatured alcohol.</b>&mdash;To remove traces of color remaining on wool
materials after the above treatment, sponge with alcohol.</p>
<p><b>Bleaches.</b>&mdash;Try one of the following to remove remaining tobacco stains:</p>
<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide or sodium perborate.</i>&mdash;Sponge with hydrogen peroxide or
with sodium perborate solution (4 tablespoons to a pint of water). Or sprinkle
powdered sodium perborate on the moistened stain. Rinse thoroughly.</p>
<p><i>Javelle water.</i>&mdash;For stains on cotton or linen, dip the stain in Javelle water for
1 minute (no longer), remove the chlorine from the cloth with a sodium thiosulfate
solution, rinse well in water. (See <a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a> for more detailed instructions.)
Do not use Javelle water on silk or wool materials. Be sure to test the cloth
for colorfastness before applying this bleach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h3 class="center">Tomato Juice and Catsup</h3>
<p><b>Cold water and glycerine.</b>&mdash;Sponge the stain thoroughly with cold water to
remove all the loose foodstuff. Next work glycerine into the stain, and let
stand for half an hour. Then wash with soap and water.</p>
<p><b>Hydrogen peroxide or sodium perborate.</b>&mdash;Remove any remaining stain
by sponging with hydrogen peroxide or with sodium perborate solution (4
tablespoons to 1 pint of water). Sponge or rinse with cold water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Urine</h3>
<p>These stains differ so in composition that it is impossible to give methods which
will be successful in all cases. If the color of the cloth is not destroyed but only
changed, it may be restored. Normal human urine is usually acid, as is also that
of all meat-eating animals. Therefore sponge such stains with a weak ammonia or
soda solution. (See Acids, <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>.) If the stain is alkaline, sponge with lemon
juice or vinegar. (See Alkalies, <a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Warm water followed by salt and water.</b>&mdash;Sponge with warm water.
Warm salt water may be used (about &frac12; cup salt to 1 quart water). Apply and
let stand 15 minutes; then sponge with clear water.</p>
<p><b>Hydrogen peroxide or sodium perborate.</b>&mdash;Apply a few drops of hydrogen
peroxide (see <a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>) or sponge with a mixture of 1 level teaspoon sodium
perborate to 1 pint peroxide. Powdered sodium perborate may be sprinkled on
the dampened stain. Rinse thoroughly in water.</p>
<h3 class="center">Walnut (Black)</h3>
<p><b>Soap solution.</b>&mdash;Boil washable materials in soapy water (a half-inch cube of
laundry soap to each cup of water). This will completely remove fresh stains
on cotton or linen. If this treatment leaves a gray color, as it sometimes does
with an old stain, treat with Javelle water as follows:</p>
<p><b>Javelle water.</b>&mdash;Mix Javelle water with an equal amount of hot water.
Soak the stained place for 1&frac12; hours in this solution, and rinse thoroughly. Then
treat with oxalic acid solution (1 teaspoon oxalic acid to 1 pint water), and rinse
again. This will remove a week-old stain and will not seriously injure the material.
Soaking the stain in Javelle water of full strength, however, rots the
material. Do not use Javelle water on silk or wool.</p>
<h3 class="center">Water Spots</h3>
<p>Some silks, rayons, and wools are spotted by water. To remove such spots,
dampen the entire material evenly, either by sponging with clean water or by
shaking in the steam from a briskly boiling teakettle. Then press it while still
damp. Scratching with the fingernail or a stiff brush or rubbing the cloth
between the hands will sometimes remove the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h3 class="center">White Sauces, Cream Soups</h3>
<p>If the material is washable, laundering in warm soap and water will remove
these spots. For nonwashable materials, sponge with warm water, let dry,
then sponge with a grease solvent&mdash;carbon tetrachloride, gasoline, or benzene.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
